# Miscellaneous scripts

These are some scripts I made that I find useful.

The following are short descriptions: see each folder for more details.

- **autotype** allows to type text programmatically in macOS,
  using JavaScript for Automation.
  Meant to be used especially from other scripts
  running from the hotkey window of iTerm.

- **finder-open-tab** opens a new Finder tab at a given path.

- **notes** helps manage a collection of plain-text notes, including creating,
  accessing, and archiving notes.
  (Requires [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).)

- **pw** can be used together with [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org)
  to select quickly a password to display, copy to the clipboard, or type out.
  (Requires [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org)
  and [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).)

- **remind** sets reminders on Apple's Reminders.app.

(Not all of them are there yet.)
